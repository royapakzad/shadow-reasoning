# LLM Tasks Completed Log

This file tracks significant tasks, changes, and decisions made during the development of the Multilingual LLM Mini-Lab.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Password Fix, Logging, and Task Tracking Setup

*   **Task:** Resolved password authentication issue.
    *   **Details:** The password in `README.md` ("demo123") mismatched the one in `constants.ts` ("llm_workshop_2024!").
    *   **Fix:** Updated `CORRECT_PASSWORD` in `constants.ts` to "demo123" for consistency.
*   **Task:** Enhanced debugging for password authentication.
    *   **Details:** Added `console.log` statements in `App.tsx` (handlePasswordSubmit) and `PasswordGate.tsx` (handleSubmit) to trace password values during authentication.
*   **Task:** Improved code commenting.
    *   **Details:** Added more inline comments in `App.tsx`, `PasswordGate.tsx`, and `constants.ts` for better code understanding.
*   **Task:** Setup developer task tracking.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Created this `llmtaskscompleted.md` file.
        *   Added a note in `README.md` under "Developer Notes" to remind developers to update this log file after completing tasks.
        *   Updated the "File System Overview" in `README.md` to include this new file.
*   **Next Steps:** Continue with planned feature development or address further bugs. Ensure API key handling is robust for any shared/demo environments.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Dual Evaluation & Language Inconsistency Metrics

*   **Task:** Implemented separate evaluations for English and Native language responses and added language inconsistency metrics.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Type Definitions (`types.ts`):**
            *   Renamed `RubricScores` to `LanguageSpecificRubricScores`.
            *   Introduced `InconsistencyMetrics` interface for comparative evaluation (word counts, accuracy/comprehensiveness comparison, observations).
            *   Updated `EvaluationRecord` to store separate `english` and `native` scores (both `LanguageSpecificRubricScores`), and `inconsistency` scores (`InconsistencyMetrics`).
        *   **Constants (`constants.ts`):**
            *   Defined `INITIAL_LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_RUBRIC_SCORES` and `INITIAL_INCONSISTENCY_METRICS`.
            *   Added `COMPARISON_SCALE_OPTIONS` for the new comparative evaluation criteria.
        *   **Application Logic (`App.tsx`):**
            *   Adjusted state to manage `currentEnglishScores`, `currentNativeScores`, and `currentInconsistencyMetrics`.
            *   `handleRunExperiment` now:
                *   Generates English and Native LLM responses independently.
                *   Handles errors for each API call separately, displaying combined errors if necessary.
                *   Auto-calculates `working_links` for each language's rubric.
                *   Auto-calculates `word_count_english` and `word_count_native` for `InconsistencyMetrics`.
            *   `handleEvaluationSubmit` now collects and saves the new structured scores into `EvaluationRecord`.
            *   The display of saved evaluations has been updated to clearly show English scores, Native scores, and all Inconsistency metrics.
        *   **Evaluation Form (`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`):**
            *   Restructured to use a reusable `RubricSection` component, rendered once for English and once for Native language responses. Each section includes the standard rubric and auto-calculated working links.
            *   Added a new "Language Inconsistency Evaluation" section with:
                *   Read-only display for auto-calculated word counts (English and Native).
                *   Radio button groups for "Accuracy Comparison" and "Comprehensiveness Comparison" using `COMPARISON_SCALE_OPTIONS`.
                *   A textarea for "Other Inconsistency Observations."
            *   Updated props and event handlers to manage the new structured score state.
        *   **LLM Service (`services/llmService.ts`):**
            *   Minor refinements to error messages for clarity.
*   **Behavioral Change:** The full evaluation form (including inconsistency metrics) is displayed only if both English and Native LLM responses are successfully generated. Error messages for individual LLM call failures are displayed.
*   **Next Steps:** Thorough testing of the complete evaluation workflow, including edge cases with API responses. Review UI/UX of the enhanced evaluation form for clarity and ease of use. Update `README.md` to reflect these significant changes.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Major UI/UX Overhaul

*   **Task:** Performed a major UI/UX overhaul for improved clarity and aesthetics.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Scenario Data (`public/scenarios.json`, `types.ts`):**
            *   Scenarios in `scenarios.json` now *only* contain an English prompt (`prompt_en`) and a category. `languages` and `prompt_native` fields removed.
            *   `Scenario` type in `types.ts` updated accordingly.
        *   **Native Languages (`constants.ts`):**
            *   `AVAILABLE_NATIVE_LANGUAGES` is now a static list of predefined languages for the translation target dropdown.
        *   **UI/UX Overhaul (General):**
            *   **Theming (`index.html`, `tailwind.config.js`):** Implemented a more robust theming system (light/dark) using CSS variables, inspired by shadcn/ui. Added Inter font.
            *   **Layout (`App.tsx`):** Main layout reorganized into distinct, styled cards (Setup, LLM Responses, Evaluation, Saved Evaluations) for better visual hierarchy and modern look.
            *   **Component Styling:** All major components (`Header.tsx`, `ScenarioSelector.tsx`, `ModelSelector.tsx`, `ResultViewer.tsx`, `EvaluationForm.tsx`, `PasswordGate.tsx`) were restyled using new theme variables and Tailwind utility classes for a consistent, cleaner, and more professional appearance. This includes improved spacing, typography, borders, and shadows.
            *   **Loading & Feedback:** Enhanced loading indicators and error displays for LLM response generation.
*   **Next Steps:** Focus on refining specific interactions, form usability, and addressing any visual inconsistencies.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Slider-based Rubric & UI Refinements

*   **Task:** Converted evaluation rubric from radio buttons to interactive sliders and further refined UI/UX.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Rubric Sliders (`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`):**
            *   Modified the `RubricSection` component. Each rubric dimension now uses an `<input type="range">` (slider).
            *   Sliders range from 1 to 5 (or as defined by the scale).
            *   The current numerical value of the slider and its corresponding descriptive label (e.g., "Good (4)") are displayed for clarity.
            *   Applied Tailwind CSS classes (`form-range`) and a custom plugin in `tailwind.config.js` to style sliders for better visual appeal and consistency across themes.
        *   **UI/UX Enhancements (`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`, `tailwind.config.js`):**
            *   Improved spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy within the `EvaluationForm` and its sub-sections.
            *   Enhanced styling for section titles, descriptions, and form elements for a cleaner, more modern look.
            *   Focused on accessibility for sliders, including proper labeling and focus states.
            *   Refined card styling and overall aesthetics of the evaluation section.
        *   **Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`):**
            *   Added a custom plugin to provide more control over slider track and thumb styling, using CSS variables for theme compatibility.
*   **README Update:** Updated `README.md` to reflect the change to a slider-based rubric and ongoing UI enhancements.
*   **Next Steps:** Test slider usability thoroughly across different browsers. Continue with any final UI polishing and address accessibility concerns.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Entity Extraction & Speech I/O Foundation

*   **Task:** Implemented entity extraction in evaluation summaries and laid foundational work for future speech input/output.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Entity Extraction:**
            *   **`services/textAnalysisService.ts` (New):** Created service to extract URLs, emails, phone numbers, potential personal names, and potential organization names using regex and heuristics.
            *   **`types.ts` Updated:** `LanguageSpecificRubricScores` now includes fields for lists and counts of these extracted entities, replacing the old `working_links`. `ExtractedEntities` helper type added.
            *   **`constants.ts` Updated:** `INITIAL_LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_RUBRIC_SCORES` and `RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS` keys updated to reflect new entity structure.
            *   **`App.tsx` Integration:** Calls `analyzeTextResponse` after LLM responses, updates state, and saves extracted entities in `EvaluationRecord`. "Saved Evaluations" display significantly updated to show these details.
            *   **`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`:** Removed the "Working Links Count (Auto-calculated)" field as it's now part of comprehensive entity display in saved evaluations.
        *   **Speech I/O Foundation:**
            *   **`metadata.json`:** Added `"microphone"` to `requestFramePermissions`.
            *   **UI Placeholders:** Added non-functional microphone icon buttons in `ScenarioSelector.tsx` (for prompt input) and speaker icon buttons in `ResultViewer.tsx` (for response output).
*   **README Update:** Detailed the new entity extraction feature and the groundwork for speech I/O.
*   **Next Steps:** Full implementation of Web Speech API for the placeholder icons. Refine entity extraction accuracy.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - New Evaluation Criteria Implementation

*   **Task:** Implemented a completely new set of evaluation criteria focusing on Single Response Evaluation (Section A) and Cross-Language Comparison (Section B).
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Type Definitions (`types.ts`):**
            *   `LanguageSpecificRubricScores` rewritten for Section A: `factual_accuracy`, `actionability`, `references_working_count`, `references_overall_quality`, `named_entities_quality`, `tone_clarity`. `ExtractedEntities` remains.
            *   `InconsistencyMetrics` rewritten for Section B: `semantic_consistency`, `depth_detail_match`, `moderation_discrepancy` (and details), `reference_disparity` (and details), `formulation_difference` (and details).
            *   `RubricDimension` key type updated.
        *   **Constants (`constants.ts`):**
            *   `RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS` completely rewritten for new Section A criteria.
            *   `INITIAL_LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_RUBRIC_SCORES` and `INITIAL_INCONSISTENCY_METRICS` updated.
            *   `SEMANTIC_MATCH_SCALE_OPTIONS` and `YES_NO_UNSURE_OPTIONS` defined for new scales.
        *   **Application Logic (`App.tsx`):**
            *   State management updated for new score structures.
            *   `handleEvaluationSubmit` saves `EvaluationRecord` with the new structures. Word counts for English/Native responses added to `EvaluationRecord` for display.
            *   "Saved Evaluations" display overhauled to present Section A and Section B criteria. Helper functions for labels added.
        *   **Evaluation Form (`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`):**
            *   Major overhaul:
                *   `RubricSection` modified for Section A, including special handling for "References and Links" (displaying auto-detected entity counts, manual input for working count, and slider for quality).
                *   "Language Inconsistency Evaluation" section completely redesigned for Section B metrics (sliders for consistency/depth, radio groups with text areas for discrepancy/disparity/difference).
                *   Displays auto-calculated word counts for context.
*   **README Update:** "Human-Rights Aware Evaluation" and "Analyze Language Inconsistency" sections rewritten to detail the new framework. Relevant data structure and component descriptions updated.
*   **Next Steps:** Thorough testing of the new evaluation form and data saving/display.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Fix for Anthropic API CORS Issue

*   **Task:** Resolved persistent errors when calling the Anthropic API from the browser.
    *   **Details:** Users were encountering a `Connection error` which was identified as a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue. The Anthropic API is not designed to be called directly from a client-side browser application for security reasons.
    *   **Fix:** To ensure a stable, error-free user experience, the Anthropic model (Claude 3 Haiku) has been removed from the application. This involved:
        *   Removing Anthropic from `AVAILABLE_MODELS` in `constants.ts`.
        *   Deleting all Anthropic-related logic from `services/llmService.ts`.
        *   Removing API key checks for Anthropic in `App.tsx` and `components/ApiKeyWarning.tsx`.
        *   Updating `types.ts` and `index.html` to remove references to the Anthropic SDK and model types.
    *   **Outcome:** The application now robustly supports the remaining models, eliminating the source of the errors and providing a more reliable platform for evaluation.
*   **README Update:** The README file has been updated to reflect the removal of Anthropic and explain the technical reasoning (CORS policy).
*   **Next Steps:** Continue focusing on features for the supported models.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Evaluation Framework Overhaul (UN B-Tech Alignment)

*   **Task:** Replaced the entire evaluation framework with a new system based on the UN B-Tech Project's GenAI taxonomy of harm.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Conceptual Shift:** The evaluation moved from generic quality metrics to a human rights-based harm assessment.
        *   **Type Definitions (`types/evaluation.ts`):**
            *   `LanguageSpecificRubricScores` was completely redefined to assess harms related to `Access to Information`, `Non-Discrimination`, `Safety & Dignity`, `Freedom of Expression`, and `Access to Remedy`.
            *   `InconsistencyMetrics` was redefined as `HarmDisparityMetrics` to explicitly compare the level of harm between language outputs.
        *   **Constants (`constants/rubric.ts`, `constants/initializers.ts`):**
            *   Created new scales and categorical options reflecting different levels of harm (e.g., `HARM_SCALE`, `NON_DISCRIMINATION_OPTIONS`).
            *   `RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS` was rewritten to generate the new harm assessment form.
            *   Initial state constants were updated for the new data structures.
        *   **Evaluation Form (`components/EvaluationForm.tsx`):**
            *   Completely rebuilt to implement the new two-part evaluation: "Section A: Harm Assessment" and "Section B: Cross-Language Harm Disparity".
            *   The form now uses a mix of sliders and categorical options with detailed descriptions rooted in human rights principles.
            *   The `isDiscrepancyFlagged` logic was removed, as the new disparity metrics cover this in a more structured way.
        *   **Saved Reports (`components/MultilingualLab.tsx`):**
            *   The display for saved evaluations was overhauled to present the detailed results of the new harm-based assessment, making reports much more comprehensive and aligned with the new framework.
*   **README Update:** The "Human-Rights Aware Evaluation" section was updated to describe the new methodology and its alignment with the UN B-Tech taxonomy.
*   **Next Steps:** Fine-tune the descriptions and labels in the evaluation form for maximum clarity to evaluators. Monitor feedback on the usability of the new, more complex rubric.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Dual-Mode Scenario Input (CSV Upload & Custom)

*   **Task:** Re-introduced scenario functionality with a flexible dual-input system.
    *   **Details:** Based on user feedback, the single custom prompt field was replaced with a more versatile system.
        *   **UI Toggle:** A toggle control was added to allow users to switch between "Custom Scenario" and "Upload CSV" input modes.
        *   **CSV Upload:**
            *   Implemented a file input that appears when in "Upload CSV" mode.
            *   Added robust client-side parsing for CSV files, requiring `context` and `prompt` headers.
            *   Error messages are shown for invalid file formats or missing headers.
        *   **Scenario Selection:** After a valid CSV is uploaded, a dropdown menu is populated with all scenarios from the file, indexed by their row number.
        *   **Workflow:** Selecting a scenario from the dropdown automatically combines its `context` and `prompt` fields to form the "Column A" prompt for the experiment. This then triggers the auto-translation for the "Column B" prompt, creating a seamless workflow from scenario selection to experiment execution.
    *   **Code Impact:**
        *   `components/ReasoningLab.tsx` was significantly updated to manage the state for the input mode, parsed scenarios, and selected scenario.
        *   `types/scenario.ts` was re-created to define the `CsvScenario` type.
        *   `types/index.ts` was updated to re-export the new scenario type.
*   **Outcome:** This change provides evaluators with the power to run single, ad-hoc tests via the custom input, or to efficiently work through a large, predefined set of scenarios by uploading a single CSV file.
